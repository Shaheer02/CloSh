# CloSh
### This project is a clone shell (closh) designed using C
# This project will take inputs from the user and run the requested process, for running processes parallel we simply execute the statment side by side within a for loop and for sequential processes we execute each process and then wait until it finishes before we move onto the next. There are timeout counters that will detect when a process has exceeded the allotted timeout duration which will then kill the running process.
